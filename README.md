# NYC Restaurant Inspection Results Analysis

* Analyzed dataset containing every sustained or not yet adjudicated violation citation from every full or special program inspection conducted up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias in an active status.

* I was specifically interested in finding out answers to following questions for Manhattan
  *	Identify restaurants with “no violations” and restaurants with “most violations”
  *	Identify best and worst restaurants by cuisine (see if anything surprises you)
  *	Identify how inspection and grading have changed over time (2017 - 2019) for different cuisines

* For this analysis, I performed following steps
  * Data Extraction
  * Data Cleaning/Feature Engineering
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Data Visualizations for final findings
